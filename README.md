# Hi there, I'm João Pedro! 👋

### 🚀 About Me

My name is **João Pedro dos Santos Alves**, and I am a developer passionate about building new things and solving problems. My journey in technology began in 2023 with a technical program at **ETEC**, where I built my foundation and have been refining my skills ever since.

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in **Computer Science at SPTech**, focused on evolving technically and tackling the challenges.

🌎 In 2025, I took time to live an incredible international experience. I went abroad to improve my English and expand my professional network.<br>
🙂 I enjoy learning, building, collaborating, and adapting to new challenges. I am always moving forward, striving to grow both professionally and personally.
